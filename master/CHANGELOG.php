3. Known Bugs
-------------
! admin\models\webservice.php 
  If you have more then one Cyclos Instances with Multicommunity access all GroupFiltre (organsiations) with the same ID are displayed!
! Modul Cyclos Category selector is only working if you disable "Search Engine Friendly URLs" in Cyclos Configuration. 
! If the connection is not working you will have a blank screen in Beta version (sorry for that). 
  That means you have to define a new channel with the correct URL or have to check your Cyclos Webservice Parameters
